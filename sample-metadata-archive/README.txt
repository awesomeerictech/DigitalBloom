You need to create an archive of the type .tar.xz, on windows and other desktop platform use peazip or 7-zip to create such archives and notepad-plus-plus to modify text files, I prefer 7-zip. On android install Zarchiver app on google play to work with archives and ES File explorer to use es note editor to modify text. You can also use AI tools to create all the files for metadata archive and just use 7-zip or zarchiver to create .tar.xz. All the best in your business!
