## What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

* Affected platform: **Android** or **Windows**
* DigitalBloom version (e.g. **v27.10**)
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Expected behavior vs actual behavior

## Response Timeline

Once a valid security report is received, we aim to follow this timeline:

* **Acknowledgement:** within **48 hours** (business days)
* **Initial assessment:** within **7 calendar days**
* **Mitigation or fix:**

  * **Critical issues:** as soon as feasible, typically within **30 days**
  * **Non-critical issues:** scheduled for a future release
* **Coordinated disclosure:** after a fix or agreed mitigation is available

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and platform constraints.

## Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities as follows:

* **Critical**
  Remote code execution, full system compromise, or bypass of major security controls.

* **High**
  Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure, or major service disruption.

* **Medium**
  Limited data leakage or abuse requiring specific conditions.

* **Low**
  Minor issues with minimal security impact.

Severity classification will be communicated during assessment.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for:

* The **latest released version** (currently **v27.10**)
* Older versions may not receive fixes unless the issue is critical

Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

## Binary-Only Considerations

This repository distributes **compiled binaries only**.

* Fixes are delivered through **new binary releases**
* Source code is not publicly available in this repository
* Some security reviews or audits may be handled under **commercial or NDA terms**

For details, see `BINARY_ONLY.md`.

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that reporters:

* Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue

* Act in good faith to protect users and businesses

We are committed to respectful, professional collaboration with security researchers.
